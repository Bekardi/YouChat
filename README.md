YouChat - is the application in Java that I have developed as a learning project. 
YouChat application allows multiple users
to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real time, it also allows users to
see how many users are online, and to check the message history with a particular user.
You can find more information about my project in the pdf file here : https://github.com/Bekardi/YouChat/blob/main/Concurrent%20Systems_%20CA2_%20YouChat%20(1).pdf.
