YouChat - is the application in Java that I have developed as a learning project. 
YouChat application allows multiple users
to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real time, it also allows users to
see how many users are online, and to check the message history with a particular user.

The chat application uses various concepts and techniques in Java, such as socket
programming, threads, data structures, algorithms. Socket programming allows the creation
of network applications that communicate with each other using TCP/IP protocol.
